<p>The idea of developement has always been in us we always have desires how our life should look like.Similarly we have ideas how a country should look like.What are essencial thing required by the people?What should  be done to make life of all people better. How should all people live together? What can be done for more equality answering to this question and making developement goal to fullfill country demand is called national developement. The way we live today is inspired from our past. It is only through Democretic Politics tha our hope becomes possibilities</p>
    <h1><bold><i>What Developement promises- Different People Different Goals</i></bold></h1>
    <p>Different persons can have different goals and what may be developement for one can also be harmful for another. <i><big>eg:</big></i> Construction of dams may be a developement goal for some industrialist to get a regular supply of electricity or some farmersfor their irrigation facility but it is harmful for a tribal community because they will lost their house after construction of dam.</p>
<h1><bold><big>Income and other goals.</big></bold></h1>
<p>What are requirment of people regular work and more income but this is not only requirments of people. Apart of this people want equality,job securityrespect etc... Similar for developement people look at mixed goals.  </p>
    <h1><big><i>National Developement</i></big></h1>
    <p>As different people have different national developement goal thinking of all and doing justice in favour of all is developement. Eg: For construction of dams to help farmer , industrialist, Tribals must be transfered from that construction area and must be given a new home.</p>
